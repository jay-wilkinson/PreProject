#  PreProject


This repo contains details about how to submit a project to us as part of the Modern Labor application process. 

What is the thing you are most proud of building? Whilst we do not expect entire applications or comprehensive projects, we put a lot of weight in trainees having shipped some code in the past - *even if it is very basic*. This might be some working code from a tutorial that you worked through, a small personal site that you have put together or a script that does something interesting.


### The Program

Content is free, but living is not. We pay our trainees $2000 per month for 5 months to learn how to code and build a project portfolio that will get them their first full-stack developer job. The program is split into 2 parts - the education section and the project section. 

The education section of the program is to ensure that all Modern Labor trainees have the same solid foundations - even if this means that you have to go through some content that you may already feel like you know. This section is self-paced and is built around online content - the sooner you get through it, the sooner you can start working on projects. 

The second part of the program is where you will earn your stripes. We have a pipeline of real-world work for our trainees to work on. We believe that the best way to learn (and the best way to demonstrate experience to employers) is by doing. For this part of the program, we will feed you projects to work on as a team. You will have a project manager and will get feedback on all code written.


### What we look for

When we assess potential Modern Labor trainees we optimize for the following things: 

* Evidence of grit and determination
* A commitment to learning to code - usually demonstrated by having done some Udemy, Coursera, EdX courses in the past along with small personal projects
* We **love** to see code that has been shipped and is live in the real world - even the smallest and most basic of projects are impressive to us if you have shipped them live on the internet



## ACTION: Project Submission

You do not need to have much experience to be accepted onto Modern Labor. The program is designed for those who still have hundreds of hours of practice before they can land their first full-stack role. 

However, we look for people who have a demonstrated ability to finish and ship code - even if it is very basic. There is no right or wrong for this task.  

For this section of the application we ask you to submit a project that you have worked on. Some examples include: 

* A project based on some code that you wrote as part of a tutorial
* A project that you completed as part of the FreeCodeCamp syllabus
* A small web app you have built to learn a framework
* A piece of code that does something interesting
* Some code that you have hacked away at for a while
* A piece of code that you wrote to make your life easier in some way
* Really it can be anything... 



### What to submit



* A link to a GitHub repo that contains your project
* Fill in this form about your project: [https://modernlabor.typeform.com/to/uvzvfy](https://modernlabor.typeform.com/to/uvzvfy)
* A link to somewhere we can find your project live (optional but highly recommended)

## Project Ideas

The purpose of this submission is to demonstrate to us that you are committed to learning to code and that you have a demonstrated ability to teach yourself something. 

If you have not go any projects to submit then we suggest that you spend some time working on a project. There is no rush or deadline to complete this - applications are done on a rolling basis and there are new cohorts starting regularly. It is better to take your time and complete your application thoroughly than rushing through it.
